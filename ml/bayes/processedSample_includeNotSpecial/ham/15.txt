Hi
Peter
The
hotels
are
the
ones
that
rent
out
the
tent
They
are
all
lined
up
on
the
hotel
grounds
So
much
for
being
one
with
nature
more
like
being
one
with
couple
dozen
tour
groups
and
nature
have
about
100M
of
from
that
trip
can
go
through
them
and
get
you
jpgs
of
my
scenic
Where
are
you
and
Jocelyn
now
New
York
Will
you
come
to
Tokyo
for
Chinese
New
Year
Perhaps
to
see
the
two
of
you
then
will
go
to
for
winter
holiday
to
see
my
mom
Take
care
